## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML (helpful but not required)

### Running the Code

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd javascript-mastery
   ```

2. **For HTML files**: Open `index.html` files directly in your browser

3. **For JavaScript files**: 
   - Open in browser console
   - Use Node.js: `node filename.js`
   - Copy-paste into browser developer tools

### Browser Developer Tools
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
- **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K`
- **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+I`

## 💡 How to Use This Repository

### Study Approach
1. **Read the code** in each file
2. **Run the examples** to see output
3. **Modify the code** to experiment
4. **Create your own examples** based on the concepts

### Practice Tips
- Try to predict the output before running code
- Experiment with different values and scenarios
- Break the code intentionally to understand error messages
- Write your own variations of each example
